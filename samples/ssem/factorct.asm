; The first program was written by Tom Kilburn. It was a program to find the highest proper factor of any number a;
; this was done by trying every integer b from a-1 downward until one was found that divided exactly into a.
; The necessary divisions were done not by long division but by repeated subtraction of b
; (because the "Baby" only had a hardware subtractor).

; When stopped, the answer will appear on line 27
; With the number entered in the present file, it should be 131072
